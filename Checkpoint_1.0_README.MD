Yesh: 
-I created the initial intro READ.ME file and combined all of our thoughts about topics, methods, decision makers, etc. into the read me file 
-I created the GitHub repository 
-Created two different data sets that we have been working with (1) A gin dataset that we used for the previous assignments merged with the ACS dataset that contains the percentage of the population who have a high school degree and who have a masters degree. I needed to create this dataset for my forecasting exploration as these datasets had dates involved but the new project datasets did not have any date columns to use for forecasting. (2) A dataset that involves merging all liquor sales and the Iowa ACS dataset that was uploaded onto Canvas.
- I did a lot of initial forecasting exploration. I used the time series data from the data sets of gin sales to forecast sales in dollars, bottles, and volumes of the upcoming 8 quarters using a seasonal naive model. I showed an example of how I would do this for each county so we could inform the decision maker of the counties that are projected to have the largest percent increase in future sales. This information could be helpful when allocating funds to specific areas that may have more gin consumption. I tried to also get an ARIMA model to work as well so that I could compare model performance with the snaive model but am still troubleshooting why I am getting the same point forecast for each upcoming quarter. I also am considering splitting into a training and test data set so that I can assess model performance.

Mingdong:
-I was suggesting improvements and combining data analysis with future reports to be submitted
-I created Tableau dashboard and data visualization
-Created a sheet that has the total sale for the top 5 county in Iowa, visually compare total sales figures between counties, revealing any notable differences in liquor consumption patterns. Created a sheet that has the top 5 county income level in Iowa that's above bachelor degree, counties likely experience higher levels of economic prosperity compared to others in Iowa. The fact that residents in these counties have incomes above the national average for individuals with bachelor's degrees suggests the presence of industries or sectors that offer well-paying jobs and opportunities for career advancement. Created another map that has the Total sale for each county and combined them in dashboard to shows thta's there's pattern between the education & income level and the liquor sales, Higher-income individuals may have greater disposable income, allowing them to spend more on luxury goods and recreational activities such as alcohol consumption. As a result, areas with higher income levels may see higher liquor sales volumes.


Updates on the major areas:

1. Propose a research topic (Option 1 or Option 2):
We chose option 2 and are using the datasets available on the class Canvas.


2. Create a GitHub repository and establish best practices for team collaboration.
We have done this. We are still working on ironing out team collaboration because we have been messaging via Canvas. However, we divided responsibilities so that people would not be working on the same things for the checkpoint 1. 

3. Demonstrate merging of multiple data sources
We are working with two separate datasets

4. Visualize data using Tableau, R, Python, or a combination
-Forecasating visualizations were created usingi the forecast package in RStudio


5. Generate meaningful summary statistic (KPIs) of the data

6. Submit draft of progress at Checkpoint 1 and Checkpoint 2.

7. Summarize your findings in a short video presentation.

8. Publish a detailed, well formatted markdown report of your analytical story to your
